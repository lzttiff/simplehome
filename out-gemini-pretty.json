          "Major": "Every 3-5 years. A professional inspection of the roof structure, decking, underlayment, and shingles. Given the roof's age, this service should be a consultation for a full roof replacement.",
          "reasoning": "A composite shingle roof has a typical lifespan of 20-30 years. Installed in 1995, this roof is at the end of its expected service life, making regular inspections critical. The annual minor service is recommended to catch potential leaks early. The next major service date is based on a 5-year interval from the last service, but it should be treated as a deadline to plan for a full roof replacement to avoid potential catastrophic failure and interior water damage."

Perform bi-annually (e.g., late spring and late fall), or more frequently (quarterly) if surrounded by many trees.",
          "Major": "Thorough inspection of the entire gutter system, including seams, seals, downspout connections, fascia attachment, and proper pitch. Repair any significant leaks, re-seal joints, re-attach loose sections, and ensure downspouts direct water effectively away from the foundation. Check for signs of rust or corrosion. Perform annually."
        },
        "reasoning": "Gutters are crucial for protecting a home's foundation and exterior from water damage. Regular cleaning (Minor Service) prevents clogs that can lead to overflow, fascia rot, and foundation issues. A more comprehensive annual inspection (Major Service) ensures the structural integrity and long-term effectiveness of the system. Since no previous service dates were provided, the 'next' service dates are set proactively based on current best practices, with today (October 27, 2023) as the reference point for calculation. The 'quad' model refers to the profile of the gutter, which doesn't alter the fundamental maintenance requirements of debris removal and structural integrity checks."

They will check and adjust the spring tension, test the door balance, inspect cables for fraying, check roller condition, and perform a comprehensive safety inspection and tune-up of the opener mechanism.",
          "reasoning": "A garage door is a large, heavy, moving object under high tension, making regular maintenance critical for safety and longevity. Quarterly minor services by the homeowner ensure smooth operation and catch early signs of wear. An annual professional service is essential for safely adjusting high-tension springs and performing in-depth checks that prevent catastrophic failures and costly repairs.

Sanding any rough areas or completely stripping and re-finishing if the existing coat is failing. Thoroughly inspecting for rot, significant cracks, structural damage (like ledger board, joists, or posts), or pest infestations. Replacing any severely damaged or rotted boards. Applying a fresh coat of high-quality stain or sealant, ensuring full protection. Checking and tightening all fasteners, and ensuring proper drainage."

An annual 'Minor Service' in the spring allows for post-winter clean-up and reapplication of protective finishes before heavy summer use. A more comprehensive 'Major Service' every 3-5 years addresses deeper wear, significant environmental damage, and structural checks, ensuring the longevity and safety of the patio. The dates are calculated assuming a fresh start or unknown history, with the first minor service scheduled for Spring 2024 and major service three years thereafter."

Apply a fresh coat of high-quality stain or sealant to protect the wood from UV rays and moisture. Conduct a thorough structural inspection of posts, joists, and railings.",
          "reasoning": "Regular maintenance is critical to preserve the structural integrity, safety, and appearance of a deck. Biannual cleaning prevents the buildup of organic matter that can lead to rot and decay. The major service of resealing or restaining the wood every 2-3 years is the most important step to protect it from water damage and sun exposure, which cause cracking, warping, and splintering. This schedule helps maximize the lifespan of your deck and ensures it remains a safe outdoor space. Frequency may need to be increased in harsh climates."
