{"results":[{"Name":"Foundation (Slab)","nextMinorServiceDate":"2026-05-01","nextMajorServiceDate":"2025-05-01","Maintenance Schedule":{"Minor":"Yearly inspection for cracks, settling, or water damage.  Address any minor issues promptly.","Major":"Every 5 years.  Thorough inspection by a foundation specialist.  May include soil testing, crack repair, and waterproofing if necessary."},"reasoning":"Given the last minor service was 2024-05-01, the next minor service is scheduled for 2026-05-01 (yearly). The last major service was at installation (2020-05-01),  a major service is recommended every 5 years, therefore the next major service is scheduled for 2025-05-01."}]}
