Ensure soil and landscaping grade slopes away from the foundation to prevent water pooling.","Major":"Every 5 years: Hire a qualified structural engineer for a professional inspection. This includes a detailed assessment of settling, crack analysis, and overall structural integrity. Address any necessary repairs like epoxy injection for significant cracks or underpinning for settling issues.","reasoning":"Regular annual visual checks help in early detection of potential issues like water damage or minor cracks, preventing costly repairs. A professional inspection every 5 years is crucial for a slab foundation to assess for subtle, long-term settlement or structural shifts that a homeowner might not notice, ensuring the long-term stability and safety of the entire home. The next minor service is scheduled one year from the last, and the next major service is scheduled five years from the installation date."}},{"Name":"Roof","nextMinorServiceDate":"2025-10-24T02:30:12.893Z","nextMajorServiceDate":"2025-10-24T02:30:12.893Z","Maintenance Schedule":{"Minor":"Annual visual inspection. Check for and replace any damaged, missing, or curling shingles. Inspect flashing around chimneys, vents, and skylights for signs of damage or leakage. Clean gutters and downspouts to ensure proper drainage.","Major":"Every 3-5 years, a professional inspection is recommended. This includes all minor service tasks, plus checking for soft spots in the roof deck, sealing any exposed nail heads, and assessing the overall granule loss and shingle integrity. Given the roof's age, this service must also include a budget and timeline for a full roof replacement.","reasoning":"The roof was installed in 1995, making it approximately 29 years old. The typical lifespan for a composite shingle roof is 20-30 years, so it is at or beyond its expected service life. Both minor (annual) and major (3-5 year) services are overdue since 2021 and 2023 respectively. Immediate inspection is crucial to assess its current condition and to plan for an imminent replacement to prevent potential leaks and structural damage."}},{"Name":"Gutter","nextMinorServiceDate":"2025-10-24T02:30:29.864Z","nextMajorServiceDate":"2025-10-24T02:30:29.864Z","Maintenance Schedule":{"Minor":"Quarterly (every 3 months): Visually inspect gutters and downspouts for leaves, twigs, and other debris.
